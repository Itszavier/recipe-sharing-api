The Recipe API will allow users to log in and contribute recipes to our database, even if they don't own them. They can simply add recipes, and we'll store them in the system. To use the API, however, users will need to generate an access token. This token will be used to authenticate their requests and help track who is using the API, enabling us to manage and possibly monetize access. The open-source aspect of the platform will focus on empowering users to contribute recipes, helping to build and expand the database collectively.
